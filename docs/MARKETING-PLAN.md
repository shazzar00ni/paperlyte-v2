**Guest Post Attribution**:

| **Publication** | **Traffic Referred** | **Downloads** | **Cost** | **CAC** |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| Dev.to | 800 | 32 | $300 | $9.38 |
| Medium (Startup) | 1,200 | 48 | $400 | $8.33 |

### CAC by Channel Breakdown

Detailed cost per acquisition for each marketing channel:

| **Channel** | **Monthly Spend** | **Visits** | **Downloads** | **CPC/CPM** | **Conversion Rate** | **CAC** | **LTV** | **LTV:CAC** | **Action** |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|---------|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Organic Search** | $500 (SEO tools) | 15,000 | 150 | N/A | 1.0% | $3.33 | $50 | 15:1 | Scale content |
| **Content Marketing** | $1,000 (writers) | 8,000 | 120 | N/A | 1.5% | $8.33 | $50 | 6:1 | Maintain |

**CAC Calculation Components**:
- **Organic CAC**: (SEO tools + content creation + time) / organic downloads
- **Paid CAC**: Ad spend / attributed downloads
- **Referral CAC**: (Incentive cost per referral × referrals) / referred downloads
- **Blended CAC**: Total marketing spend / total downloads

**Reallocation Triggers** (from Execution Infrastructure section):

- **Maintain**: CAC 30-50% LTV ($15-$25)
- **Optimize**: CAC 50-100% LTV ($25-$50)
- **Kill**: CAC > 100% LTV (>$50)

**Monthly CAC Review**:
- Calculate CAC for each channel
- Compare to LTV estimates by channel
- Adjust budget allocation for next month
- Test optimizations on underperforming channels before killing

### Target Validation & Hypotheses

**CRITICAL**: Many targets in this plan are aspirational hypotheses requiring validation through alpha/internal testing before being treated as commitments.

**Hypothesis Status**:

| **Metric** | **Target** | **Status** | **Validation Method** | **Baseline (Alpha)** | **Stretch Goal** | **Confidence** |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Day 1 Retention** | 40% | 🔬 Hypothesis | 100-user alpha cohort | TBD | 50% | Low (need data) |
| **Day 7 Retention** | 25% | 🔬 Hypothesis | 4-week alpha period | TBD | 35% | Low (need data) |
| **Day 30 Retention** | 15% | 🔬 Hypothesis | 2-month beta cohort | TBD | 22% | Low (need data) |
| **NPS Score** | 50 | 🔬 Hypothesis | Alpha survey (n=50+) | TBD | 60+ | Medium (can survey) |
| **Viral Coefficient** | 0.5 | 🔬 Hypothesis | Track alpha referrals | TBD | 0.7 | Low (hard to predict) |
| **Signup → Activation** | 60% | 🔬 Hypothesis | Alpha onboarding data | TBD | 75% | Medium (controllable) |
| **Email → Download** | 40% | ⚠️ Industry benchmark | Email A/B tests | 25-30% typical | 50% | Medium (can optimize) |
| **Landing Page Conversion** | 3% | ✅ Validated | Similar products | 2-4% range | 5% | High (established) |

**Legend**:
- 🔬 **Hypothesis**: Requires validation, not a commitment
- ⚠️ **Benchmark**: Based on industry data, needs testing
- ✅ **Validated**: Proven achievable in similar contexts

**Pre-Launch Validation Protocol**:
1. **Alpha Testing** (Month -2): 50-100 users, track all metrics for 4 weeks
2. **Baseline Measurement**: Establish realistic floor based on alpha data
3. **Target Refinement**: Adjust targets based on alpha performance
4. **Stretch Goals**: Set aspirational targets 1.5-2x baseline
5. **Public Commitment**: Only commit to validated baselines externally

**Ongoing Validation**:
- **Month 1**: Compare actual vs. hypothesis, update targets if >20% variance
- **Month 3**: Establish new baselines from real cohorts
- **Month 6**: Lock in annual targets based on proven performance

**Example Scenario**:
- **Hypothesis**: Day 7 retention = 25%
- **Alpha Result**: Day 7 retention = 18%
- **Action**: Set public target at 20% (realistic), internal stretch at 28%, investigate friction points
- **Communication**: "Early data shows 18% D7 retention, targeting 20%+ at scale with optimizations"
