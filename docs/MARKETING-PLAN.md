2. **Maintain** (no change):
   - On-target performance
   - Testing/learning phase (first 4 weeks)
   - Strategic importance despite neutral ROI (e.g., brand building)

3. **Scale Down** (reduce budget by 50%):
   - CAC > 50% of LTV for 2+ consecutive weeks
   - Declining performance trend
   - Low user quality (poor activation or retention)

4. **Kill** (stop immediately):
   - CAC > 100% of LTV with no improvement path
   - Consistently missing targets for 4+ weeks
   - Reputational risk or brand misalignment
   - Better alternatives identified

**Reallocation Process**:
- Weekly: Program Manager flags opportunities/concerns
