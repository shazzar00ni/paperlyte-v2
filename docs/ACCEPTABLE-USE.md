### Appeals & Remediation

Users may appeal any enforcement action by submitting a written request to legal@paperlyte.com within 14 days of notification. Appeals should include account details, violation reference (if provided), and any supporting evidence. Paperlyte will review appeals within 7 business days and communicate a final decision via email. For minor and moderate violations, users will be provided specific remediation steps and a timeframe (typically 3–7 days) to correct the issue. Successful remediation may result in account restoration.

### Notification Procedures

- Where feasible, users will receive prior notice of alleged violations and an opportunity to respond before enforcement actions (such as suspension or termination) are taken.
- Notices will specify the nature of the violation, the relevant AUP section, the enforcement action, and remediation or appeal options.
- For minor infractions, a warning and remediation period will be provided before escalation. Severe or urgent violations may result in immediate action with notice provided as soon as practicable.

### Data Handling for Reports

Violation reports may include reporter contact information, details of the alleged violation, and supporting evidence. Report data is used to investigate and enforce this AUP, and is retained for the duration of the investigation and any appeals, then for up to 3 years for compliance and pattern analysis. Severe violations may result in longer retention as required by law. Access to report data is restricted to authorized personnel. For more details, see our [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY-POLICY.md). You may request information about your report or deletion of your personal data, subject to legal and investigative requirements.
