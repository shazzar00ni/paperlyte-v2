# Paperlyte Performance Baseline Audit (Updated)

**Date:** June 11, 2026
**Auditor:** Claude Code (Automated Baseline Audit)
**Repository:** [paperlyte-v2](https://github.com/shazzar00ni/paperlyte-v2)
**Production Site:** [paperlyte.app](https://paperlyte.app) — see new finding: the repo references `paperlyte.app` consistently (README, `index.html`, `robots.txt`, metadata injection) but `scripts/generate-sitemap.cjs` hardcodes `paperlyte.com`, and the previous audit treated `.com` as authoritative
**Previous Audit:** [baseline-audit-2025-12-22.md](./baseline-audit-2025-12-22.md)
**Commits since previous audit:** ~1,497 reachable commits (`git rev-list --count 6d0af3f..HEAD`; 265 first-parent, 960 excluding merges)

## Audit Methodology

This updated audit re-runs the December 22, 2025 baseline methodology against the current codebase:

1. **Build Analysis**: Vite production build with bundle size metrics
2. **Code Quality Review**: Static analysis of TODO comments, test coverage, lint, and code patterns
3. **Security Review**: npm audit + analysis of SECURITY_REVIEW.md findings against current code
4. **Accessibility Review**: Analysis of ACCESSIBILITY.md and ARIA implementation
5. **Lighthouse Audit**: 3 runs via Lighthouse CI against the local production preview build — **now possible** (the December audit could not run Lighthouse due to missing Chrome)
6. **Technical Debt Inventory**: Comparison against the December baseline

**Environment:** Node 22.22.2, npm 10.9.7, Lighthouse 12.6.1, Headless Chromium 141, desktop preset (40ms RTT / 10 Mbps throttling, `.lighthouserc.json` config).

## Executive Summary

The codebase has improved dramatically since the December 2025 baseline. **Nearly every high-priority engineering finding from the previous audit has been resolved** (the "Download URLs Incomplete" finding carries over for both desktop artifacts — which the release workflow never produces — and app-store listings): test coverage went from large zero-coverage gaps to 95% lines across 1,757 passing tests; image optimization (AVIF/WebP + srcset), coverage thresholds, and Lighthouse CI are implemented; code splitting is in place (though all chunks are still fetched on initial load — see caveat); the critical `.gitignore`/`.env` security issue is fixed; and local Lighthouse runs now score **100/100/100/100** across all categories.

**Production launch remains blocked by legal-content issues: 14 placeholders in `src/constants/legal.ts`, plus visible placeholders and a governing-law contradiction in the shipped static legal pages (`public/privacy.html` / `public/terms.html`).** Other new findings: a corrupted font file shipped to production (`public/fonts/Inter-Variable.woff2` is an HTML document, not a font), a redundant dual font-loading strategy, a production-domain mismatch (`paperlyte.app` everywhere except the sitemap generator, which hardcodes `paperlyte.com`), and **production analytics that is entirely disconnected** — no gtag script is ever loaded and the provider framework is never initialized, so all conversion events are silent no-ops.

## Build Performance Metrics

### Bundle Size Analysis (Actual vs. Targets)

**JavaScript Bundles (gzipped):**

Render-critical chunks:

- `react-vendor-CPSICD2v.js`: 60.60 KB
- `index-axir51bO.js`: 27.74 KB
- `rolldown-runtime-xSXa1GVp.js`: 0.36 KB
- Subtotal: 88.70 KB

Split section chunks (via `React.lazy()`):

- `EmailCapture`: 2.82 KB
- `FAQ`: 2.65 KB
- `Testimonials`: 2.56 KB
- `Statistics`: 2.24 KB
- `Comparison`: 1.39 KB
- `CTA`: 0.78 KB

- **Total JS (gzipped): 101.14 KB** ✅ (Target: ≤150 KB)
- **Status:** PASSING — 33% under budget
- **Splitting caveat:** `App.tsx` renders all six lazy sections unconditionally on first render, so React starts every dynamic import immediately — the full 101.14 KB is fetched during initial page load, not deferred until scroll. The split still helps (section chunks load async without blocking first paint, and cache independently), but it is not a reduced initial payload. Viewport-triggered rendering would be needed to actually defer the section chunks.

**CSS Bundles (gzipped):**

- `index-sXtRVQL_.css`: 7.96 KB (critical path)
- Lazy section CSS (Testimonials, FAQ, Comparison, Statistics, CTA, EmailCapture): 5.19 KB combined
- **Total CSS (gzipped): 13.15 KB** ✅ (Target: ≤30 KB)
- **Status:** PASSING — 56% under budget (grew from 7.34 KB as sections were added, still well within budget)

**Build Time:**

- Vite bundling time: **0.63 seconds** ✅ (was 3.85s in December, same Vite-reported metric — Vite 8 / Rolldown bundler upgrade; varies up to ~2.2s run-to-run)
- Full `npm run build` lifecycle: **~38 seconds** — includes `prebuild` icon/mockup generation, `tsc -b`, Vite bundling, legal-date injection, and `postbuild` sitemap generation; the Vite timer above excludes all of these, so CI/deploy duration should be budgeted against the lifecycle figure

### Comparison vs. December 2025 Baseline

| Metric                  | Dec 2025      | Jun 2026                   | Change |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | ------ |
| Total JS (gzipped)      | 97.13 KB      | 101.14 KB                  | +4% (all fetched on load — see splitting caveat) |
| Total CSS (gzipped)     | 7.34 KB       | 13.15 KB                   | +79% (within budget) |
| Vite bundling time      | 3.85s         | 0.63s                      | ✅ −84% (same Vite-reported metric in both audits) |
| Code splitting          | ❌ None       | ⚠️ 6 chunks, fetched eagerly | Partial — chunks split for caching/non-blocking load, but not deferred (all imports start on first render) |
| Lighthouse runnable     | ❌ No Chrome  | ✅ 3 runs, all 100s        | Resolved |

### Asset Inventory

**Font Assets:**

- `@fontsource/inter` static weights (loaded via `src/main.tsx`): 4× WOFF2 (~97 KB) + 4× WOFF fallback (~125 KB)
- Self-hosted variable fonts (declared in `src/styles/typography.css`, preloaded in `index.html`):
  - `PlayfairDisplay-Variable.woff2`: 38.4 KB ✅ (valid WOFF2)
  - `Inter-Variable.woff2`: 1.6 KB ❌ **corrupted — file is an HTML document, not a font** (see Findings)

**Image Assets (NEW since December):**

- ✅ App mockups in AVIF/WebP/PNG with responsive variants (400w / 800w / full) in `public/mockups/`
- ✅ `srcset`/`imagesrcset` responsive image preloading in `index.html`
- ✅ AVIF/WebP icon variants (android-chrome 192/512)
- ✅ SVG favicon
- ❌ Social-card images missing: `index.html` and the metadata injection publish `/og-image.jpg` and `/twitter-image.jpg`, but only the SVG sources exist in `public/` (`SOCIAL-IMAGE-GENERATION.md` marks the JPG conversions as still needed) — shared links currently render no preview image

**PWA / Offline (NEW since December):**

- ✅ Service worker (`public/sw.js`) with versioned cache and offline fallback page
- ⚠️ Asset-cache eviction is incomplete: `pruneAssetEntries()` (60-entry cap) runs only in `onActivate()`, while `cacheFirst()` misses keep adding entries between activations — a long-lived worker can exceed the cap until the next `CACHE_VERSION` bump
- ⚠️ Cache versioning is manual and has never been bumped: `CACHE_VERSION` is the literal `'paperlyte-v1'` since introduction, and no build/release step updates it. The SW's own comment warns that when the precached shell changes, the installing and active workers share the same cache name and can mix old runtime assets with the new shell. Automate the bump (e.g., inject the build hash) or make it a required release step
- ✅ `offline.html` + dedicated offline CSS/JS
- ✅ Web manifest

### December's "Missing Optimizations" — Status

| December finding                          | Status                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No WebP/AVIF format support               | ✅ RESOLVED — AVIF/WebP variants generated for mockups and icons    |
| No responsive images (srcset)             | ✅ RESOLVED — 400w/800w/full variants with srcset                   |
| No lazy loading for images                | ✅ RESOLVED — below-fold images lazy; hero image preloaded          |
| No React.lazy() / code splitting          | ⚠️ PARTIAL — 6 sections split with `React.lazy()`/Suspense, but all are rendered unconditionally so every chunk is fetched on initial load (see splitting caveat above) |
| Limited React.memo usage                  | ✅ ADDRESSED — `Section`, `AnimatedElement`, `Button` memoized; per project decision (2026-04-29), further memoization only when profiling shows need |
| `chunkSizeWarningLimit` raised to 1000 KB | ✅ RESOLVED — TODO removed from `vite.config.ts`; manual chunking in place |

## Lighthouse Results (NEW — was not runnable in December)

**Method:** `@lhci/cli` collect+assert, 3 runs against `vite preview` production build at `http://localhost:4173/`, desktop preset, headless Chromium 141.

**Category Scores (all 3 runs identical):**

- Performance: **100/100** ✅ (threshold: ≥90 target, ≥70 CI gate)
- Accessibility: **100/100** ✅ (threshold: ≥95 target, ≥82 CI gate)
- Best Practices: **100/100** ✅ (threshold: ≥90)
- SEO: **100/100** ✅ (threshold: ≥90)

**Core Web Vitals (median of 3 runs):**

- First Contentful Paint: **441ms** ✅ (target ≤2000ms)
- Largest Contentful Paint: **632ms** ✅ (target ≤2500ms)
- Cumulative Layout Shift: **0.000** ✅ (target ≤0.1)
- Total Blocking Time: **0ms** ✅ (target ≤300ms)
- Speed Index: **442ms** ✅ (target ≤3000ms)

**Assertion warnings (non-blocking):**

- `dom-size`: 881 elements (score 0.5) — moderate DOM size; acceptable for a content-rich landing page
- `unused-javascript`: ~21 KB of `react-vendor` (58.5 KB) unused on initial load — inherent to React runtime, low priority
- `network-dependency-tree-insight`: informational critical-request-chain notice

**Caveat:** These are localhost results — no real network latency, CDN, or third-party scripts (Sentry/analytics inactive without env vars). Real-world scores will be somewhat lower. Lighthouse CI now also runs on every PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` `lighthouse` job), closing December's "no automated performance monitoring" gap.

**Corroborating CDN data point:** Netlify's Lighthouse plugin, run against the live deploy preview of this audit branch (real CDN, production headers), scored **Performance 97 / Accessibility 100 / Best Practices 92 / SEO 100 / PWA 100** — confirming the localhost results hold under real network conditions. Periodic field-data checks (CrUX / RUM) against the production domain ([paperlyte.app](https://paperlyte.app)) remain recommended.

## Code Quality

**Lint:** ✅ `npm run lint` passes with zero errors/warnings (ESLint 10, flat config).

**TODO comments in `src/`:** 1 (was 25+ in December) — a single explanatory note in `validation-email.test.ts` documenting an accepted email-regex limitation. All December TODO items in `src/analytics/index.ts`, `Privacy.tsx`, `Terms.tsx`, and `vite.config.ts` are resolved. In documentation, `grep -rn TODO docs --include='*.md'` matches 53 lines (79 including the audit reports in `docs/audit-results/`, which quote TODO items), mostly mirroring the legal placeholders.

**Tech stack (upgraded since December):** React 19.2.7, TypeScript 6.0.3 (strict), Vite 8.0.16 (Rolldown), Vitest 4.1.8, ESLint 10, Playwright 1.59.1, Sentry 10.56.

**Large components (largely unchanged — still candidates for eventual refactoring, low priority):**

1. `src/components/ui/FeedbackWidget/FeedbackWidget.tsx`: 355 lines (was 344)
2. `src/components/pages/Terms/Terms.tsx`: 346 lines (was 338)
3. `src/components/sections/Testimonials/Testimonials.tsx`: 281 lines
4. `src/components/pages/Privacy/Privacy.tsx`: 249 lines
5. `src/components/ui/EmailCapture/EmailCapture.tsx`: 244 lines
6. `src/components/ui/SVGPathAnimation/SVGPathAnimation.tsx`: 242 lines

All of these now have co-located test files, which mitigates the December maintainability concern.

## Test Coverage (was the largest gap — now resolved)

**Suite:** 1,757 tests, **0 failures**, ~31s runtime (Vitest, jsdom). Playwright E2E suite present (`tests/e2e/landing-page.spec.ts`).

**Coverage (v8 provider):**

- Statements: **93.72%** ✅ (threshold: 70%)
- Branches: **86.50%** ✅ (threshold: 70%)
- Functions: **91.28%** ✅ (threshold: 70%)
- Lines: **95.12%** ✅ (threshold: 70%)

**December gaps — all closed:**

| December finding                                   | Status                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Analytics module 0% (6 files untested)             | ✅ RESOLVED — config, index, scrollDepth, webVitals all tested |
| Constants module 0% (8 files untested)             | ✅ RESOLVED — all constants files have tests (incl. snapshots) |
| Utilities 50% (metaTags, monitoring, env untested) | ✅ RESOLVED — all utils tested; validation split into 4 test files |
| Privacy/Terms/EmailCapture untested                | ✅ RESOLVED — all have co-located test files                  |
| No coverage thresholds in vitest.config.ts         | ✅ RESOLVED — 70% thresholds enforced; JUnit + lcov reporters wired into CI |

**Coverage scope caveat:** the percentages above cover `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` only (per `vitest.config.ts` include). Two production entry points live outside that scope and have **no tests at all**: `netlify/functions/subscribe.ts` (email subscribe — validation, rate limiting, ConvertKit integration) and `netlify/edge-functions/waf.ts` (edge WAF). The 95% figure is frontend coverage, not codebase-wide.

**Remaining weak spots:**

- `netlify/functions/subscribe.ts` and `netlify/edge-functions/waf.ts`: 0% — untested production serverless/edge code (see caveat above)
- `src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts`: 64% statements / 29% functions — lowest-covered frontend module
- `src/components/sections/CTA/CTA.tsx`: 50% statements (lines 41–47 uncovered)

## Security Posture

### Overall Rating: 🟢 GOOD — improved since December

- ✅ **0 dependency vulnerabilities** (`npm audit` clean)
- ✅ **CRITICAL-001 RESOLVED**: `.env` patterns now in `.gitignore` (lines 24–29) — December's only critical security finding
- ✅ **MEDIUM-001 (SRI on Google Fonts) RESOLVED by elimination**: all fonts are now self-hosted (`@fontsource/inter` + local variable fonts); no Google Fonts CDN requests remain
- ✅ Defense-in-depth spans five layers **on Netlify** (the Vercel deployment option lacks layer 1 — `netlify/edge-functions/waf.ts` cannot run there, so scanner-UA, attack-signature, payload-size, and method checks are absent; only the header policy in `vercel.json` applies): WAF edge function (`netlify/edge-functions/waf.ts`), HTTP security headers (`netlify.toml`/`vercel.json`), two-tier CSP (dev meta tag / strict prod headers), app-boundary URL validation (`isSafeUrl()`) + prototype-pollution guards, and input validation/sanitization + best-effort rate limiting + Zod schema validation in serverless functions. Note: the 3 req/min/IP rate limit in `netlify/functions/subscribe.ts` uses a process-local in-memory `Map` that resets on cold start and is not shared across scaled instances — treat it as best-effort, not a hard guarantee; a durable/edge store would be needed for real enforcement
- ✅ Font Awesome JS replaced with bundled SVG paths — removed the inline-style CSP violation
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode; one known `any` exception remains (`ref as React.RefObject<any>` in `src/components/ui/TextReveal/TextReveal.tsx:107`, contrary to the project's no-`any` guideline — should be typed concretely); automated scanning in CI (Snyk, Scorecard, SonarCloud, CodeQL-style codescan, fuzzing workflow)

**Documentation staleness:** `docs/SECURITY_REVIEW.md` is dated 2025-11-29 and still marks MEDIUM-002 (CSP) and MEDIUM-003 (security headers) as UNRESOLVED, although both are implemented in `netlify.toml`/`vercel.json`. The document should be refreshed to reflect current state. Pre-production security testing (line ~340) also remains marked TODO.

## Accessibility Assessment

### Current Status: ⚠️ STRONG FOUNDATION, STATEMENT OVERDUE

- ✅ **Lighthouse Accessibility: 100/100** (all 3 runs) — exceeds the ≥95 target
- ✅ 81 `aria-*` attribute occurrences across non-test production components (266 including test files, which assert on them); semantic HTML; skip link; 2px focus outlines
- ✅ `prefers-reduced-motion` honored via `useReducedMotion` (tested)
- ✅ Keyboard utilities with dedicated tests (`src/utils/keyboard.test.ts`); FeedbackWidget, Header, FAQ have keyboard interaction tests
- ✅ Accessibility statement exists (`docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md`)

**Issues:**

1. ⚠️ **WCAG 2.1 AA conformance target date has passed** — `docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md` commits to full conformance by **March 31, 2026** and was last updated December 21, 2025. As of this audit (June 11, 2026) the statement has not been updated with audit results. Either publish the completed-audit results or revise the statement and target date.
2. ⚠️ The accessibility statement link in site config (`LEGAL_CONFIG.documents.accessibility`) is still `'#'` even though the statement document exists — users cannot reach it from the footer.
3. ⚠️ Manual assistive-technology testing (VoiceOver/NVDA/JAWS, touch-target verification) is described in docs but no test results are recorded in the repo. Automated scores ≠ full WCAG conformance.
4. ⚠️ **Duplicate skip link:** `index.html:103` renders a "Skip to main content" link outside the React root, and `App.tsx:47-49` renders an identical one after mounting — keyboard users tab through two consecutive controls for the same target. Lighthouse does not flag this; remove one of them.

## Technical Debt Inventory

### 🔴 Critical Issues — BLOCKS PRODUCTION (14 placeholders, down from 16 items)

**Legal Placeholders (`src/constants/legal.ts`)** — detectable at runtime via the existing `needsLegalReview()` helper:

1. `company.legalName`: `'[Company Legal Name]'`
2. `address.street`: `'[Street Address]'`
3. `address.city`: `'[City]'`
4. `address.state`: `'[State]'`
5. `address.zip`: `'[ZIP]'`
6. `address.country`: `'[Country]'`
7. `documents.cookies`: `'#'` — `docs/COOKIE-POLICY.md` is an explicit **work-in-progress outline** (overdue TODO, target was 2025-12-15); content must be written, not just linked
8. `documents.security`: `'#'` — `docs/SECURITY-POLICY.md` exists but needs review before publishing
9. `documents.dmca`: `'#'` — `docs/DMCA.md` is a **3-line stub** ("under development"); content must be written
10. `documents.accessibility`: `'#'` — `docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md` exists but names a placeholder owner ("Jane Doe") and its conformance date has passed

**Publishing gap for items 7–10:** these documents live only under `docs/`, which is **not part of the site build** — Vite copies `public/` into `dist` and nothing publishes `docs/`. Resolving the `'#'` links therefore requires completing the content *and* converting/copying each document into a publicly served artifact (like the existing `public/privacy.html`/`terms.html` pipeline), not merely updating `LEGAL_CONFIG.documents` paths.
11. `social.linkedin`: `'#'`
12. `social.discord`: `'#'`
13. `metadata.jurisdiction`: `'[State/Country]'`
14. `metadata.governingLaw`: `'[State] law'`

**Shipped static legal pages contradict the tested React components (NEW):** the footer links users to `/privacy.html` and `/terms.html` — static files copied from `public/` into `dist` — not to the React `Privacy`/`Terms` components that the test suite covers. The shipped pages have their own problems:

- `public/privacy.html` displays visible `[e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud]`-style processor placeholders and an internal warning to replace placeholders before publishing
- `public/terms.html` declares **Australian** governing law while the React `Terms.tsx` declares **Delaware, United States** — the two cannot both be right, and which one users see depends on which artifact they reach
- Neither static page is covered by any test, so the "Privacy/Terms now tested" improvement does not extend to what production actually serves
- **The production CSP breaks both pages:** all their styling lives in inline `<style>` blocks and `privacy.html` drives its cookie-preferences button with an inline `<script>` (line ~730), while the deployed CSP is `style-src 'self'; script-src 'self'` with no inline hashes/nonces — in production both policies render unstyled and the privacy control is inert. Move the CSS/JS to external files or authorize them explicitly

**Unsubstantiated social proof shipped on the landing page (NEW):** for a pre-launch waitlist product, the page presents fabricated or unverifiable claims as fact — a material consumer-trust and potential legal (false advertising) risk:

- `Hero.tsx:54-58` shows a "trusted by" company list of placeholder names: "Acme Corp", "Global", "Nebula", "Vertex", "Horizon"
- `Statistics.tsx` advertises 10M+ notes created, 99.9% uptime, and a 4.9/5 rating — none of which can exist before launch
- `src/constants/testimonials.ts` attributes endorsements to named people at real organizations including MIT (line 53) and Stripe (line 63)

Verify with real data, clearly label as illustrative, or remove before launch.

**Resolved since December:** `social.github` (now the real repo URL — this also fixed the Windows/macOS/Linux download URL construction), `social.twitter` (now `x.com/paperlyte`), Instagram added, and Privacy/Terms revision dates are now injected at build time (no stale-date TODOs).

### 🟠 High Priority

1. **Production-domain mismatch (NEW):** the repo consistently uses `paperlyte.app` (README, `index.html` canonical/OG tags, `public/robots.txt`, the build-time metadata injection), but `scripts/generate-sitemap.cjs:10` hardcodes `https://paperlyte.com` — so the generated sitemap points search engines at the wrong domain. **Worse, the sitemap never reaches production at all:** `public/sitemap.xml` is not tracked in git, and the `postbuild` step writes it to `public/` only *after* `vite build` has already copied `public/` into `dist` — so deployments contain no `/sitemap.xml` whatsoever. Fix the ordering (generate in `prebuild` or write directly into `dist`) as well as the domain; the December audit also treated `.com` as authoritative and should be read with that caveat.
2. **Corrupted production font file (NEW):** `public/fonts/Inter-Variable.woff2` is an HTML document (1.6 KB, begins `<!DOCTYPE`), not a WOFF2 font. It is preloaded in `index.html` and referenced by the primary `Inter` `@font-face` in `src/styles/typography.css`. The font silently fails to parse and the site falls back to the `@fontsource/inter` static files (so rendering is unaffected), but every visitor preloads a broken asset and the variable-font strategy is non-functional. Replace with a valid Inter variable WOFF2 — `PlayfairDisplay-Variable.woff2` (38.4 KB, valid) shows the intended pattern.
3. **Production analytics is disconnected (NEW):** every runtime tracking call goes through `@utils/analytics`, whose functions return early unless `window.gtag` exists — but **no production file loads the gtag script** (it appears only as a type declaration and guarded calls). Meanwhile the provider framework in `src/analytics/` (`analytics.init()`, `getAnalyticsConfig()`) is never initialized outside tests. Net effect: waitlist, CTA, navigation, and scroll-depth events are all silent no-ops in production — conversion measurement is not just "pending a Plausible migration", it is currently absent. Either load gtag, wire the Plausible provider into runtime initialization, or consciously accept no analytics until Phase 2.
4. **Store URLs unverified (carry-over from December's "Download URLs Incomplete" finding):** the GitHub-release URLs are fixed, but the iOS (`apps.apple.com/app/paperlyte`) and Android (`play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paperlyte.app`) URLs point to listings that won't resolve until the apps are published. This portion of the December finding remains open; verify before launch.

5. **Waitlist is Netlify-only — broken on Vercel (NEW):** both email-capture implementations POST to `/.netlify/functions/subscribe`, but `vercel.json` defines only a catch-all SPA rewrite and the repo has no Vercel/API function. On the documented Vercel deployment option the primary conversion flow cannot create subscriptions. Either add a Vercel function/proxy or document the deployment as Netlify-only.
6. **FeedbackWidget ships with no submission handler (NEW):** `App.tsx` renders `<FeedbackWidget />` without an `onSubmit` prop, and the widget's submit path then shows "Feedback submission is not yet available." Every user who opens the floating feedback form hits a guaranteed failure — wire a handler or hide the widget until one exists.
7. **Desktop download URLs cannot resolve (carry-over, corrected):** `downloads.ts` expects `Paperlyte-macOS.dmg` / `Paperlyte-Windows.exe` on the latest GitHub release, but `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds and uploads only `paperlyte-<tag>.tar.gz` (+ Sigstore bundle), and no producer for the desktop binaries exists in the repo. The macOS/Windows links will 404 even after a release; the Linux link opens a release containing only the landing-page archive. December's "Download URLs Incomplete" finding therefore remains open for desktop *and* store URLs.

**Resolved since December:** Analytics test coverage ✅, Lighthouse CI ✅ (runs in GitHub Actions on every PR), keyboard-handler concerns addressed with tested keyboard utilities ✅. (The earlier claim that GitHub-release download URLs were fixed was wrong — only the repo URL itself was fixed; see item 7.)

### 🟡 Medium Priority

1. **Dual font-loading strategy (NEW):** both `@fontsource/inter` static weights (4 weights × WOFF2+WOFF ≈ 222 KB of font files in `dist/assets/`) and a self-hosted Inter variable font are declared for the same `font-family: 'Inter'`. Once the corrupted variable font is fixed, drop one strategy — consolidating on the variable font would remove ~8 static font files from the build.
2. **Stale audit/security docs:** `docs/SECURITY_REVIEW.md` (2025-11-29) and `docs/TECHNICAL-DEBT.md` (2025-12-29) predate major fixes and overstate current debt (e.g., both still list the resolved `.gitignore` and zero-coverage issues). Refresh or mark superseded.
3. **`useAnalytics` hook coverage (64%)** remains open; the GA4→Plausible provider decision (logged 2026-04-18) is superseded by the High-priority finding that analytics is currently disconnected entirely.
4. **DOM size:** 881 elements (Lighthouse score 0.5, warning only). Worth watching as Phase 2 sections are added.

### 🟢 Low Priority

1. Large-component refactoring (FeedbackWidget 355 / Terms 346 / Testimonials 281 lines) — mitigated by full test coverage
2. ~21 KB unused `react-vendor` JS on initial load (inherent React runtime cost)
3. CTA section test coverage (50% statements)

## Findings by Severity — Summary

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Production Blockers)

1. **14 Legal Placeholders** — `src/constants/legal.ts`
   - Impact: Cannot launch without legal entity, address, jurisdiction, governing law
   - Note: the 4 document links additionally require writing the content (cookie policy is a WIP outline, DMCA is a stub) and publishing it — `docs/` is not part of the site build
   - Owner: Legal & Compliance; ETA: required before launch

2. **Shipped static legal pages broken/contradictory** — `public/privacy.html` / `public/terms.html`
   - Impact: footer links serve these untested static files; shipped privacy page shows visible `[e.g., ...]` placeholders; shipped terms declares Australian governing law vs Delaware in the React component
   - Owner: Legal & Compliance + Engineering; ETA: required before launch

3. **Unsubstantiated social proof** — `Hero.tsx`, `Statistics.tsx`, `testimonials.ts`
   - Impact: placeholder "trusted by" logos, fabricated usage/uptime/rating statistics, and testimonials attributed to real organizations (MIT, Stripe) ship as fact on a pre-launch page
   - Risk: consumer trust, false-advertising exposure
   - Owner: Product + Legal; ETA: required before launch

### 🟠 HIGH

1. **Production analytics disconnected** — gtag is never loaded and the provider framework is never initialized; all conversion events are no-ops in production
2. **Production-domain mismatch** — `scripts/generate-sitemap.cjs` hardcodes `paperlyte.com` while everything else uses `paperlyte.app`; sitemap directs search indexing at the wrong domain
3. **Corrupted `Inter-Variable.woff2`** (HTML masquerading as a font) — replace the file; visitors currently preload a broken asset
4. **Download URLs unresolved (carry-over)** — release workflow produces no desktop binaries (macOS/Windows links will 404) and App/Play Store listings are unverified
5. **Waitlist broken on Vercel** — subscribe endpoint exists only as a Netlify function; Vercel deployments have no backend for the primary conversion flow
6. **FeedbackWidget unwired** — rendered without `onSubmit`; submission always fails with "not yet available"

### 🟡 MEDIUM

1. Dual font-loading strategy — consolidate after fixing the variable font
2. Untested production serverless/edge code — `netlify/functions/subscribe.ts`, `netlify/edge-functions/waf.ts` (outside Vitest coverage scope); rate limiting is best-effort (process-local store)
3. Missing social-card images — `/og-image.jpg` and `/twitter-image.jpg` are published in meta tags but don't exist (only SVG sources); link previews are broken
4. Stale security/tech-debt documentation — refresh `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`, `TECHNICAL-DEBT.md`, `ACCESSIBILITY.md` (target date passed)
5. GA4 → privacy-first analytics migration still pending (brand-promise gap)

### 🟢 LOW

1. Component refactoring, CTA/useAnalytics coverage, unused vendor JS, DOM size monitoring

## Recommendations Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pre-Production Critical Path

- [ ] Resolve all 14 legal placeholders in `src/constants/legal.ts` (entity, address, jurisdiction, governing law, LinkedIn/Discord or remove the links)
- [ ] Reconcile the shipped static legal pages with the React components: remove the `[e.g., ...]` placeholders from `public/privacy.html`, resolve the Australia-vs-Delaware governing-law contradiction between `public/terms.html` and `Terms.tsx`, and decide on a single source of truth for legal content
- [ ] Fix sitemap delivery and domain: update `scripts/generate-sitemap.cjs` from `paperlyte.com` to the canonical domain (`paperlyte.app`) **and** fix the build ordering — the sitemap is currently written to `public/` after Vite has copied it to `dist`, so production deployments ship no `/sitemap.xml` at all
- [ ] Complete and publish the four policy documents (cookie policy is a WIP outline, DMCA is a stub, accessibility statement has a placeholder owner): finish content, convert/copy into the served site (like the `public/privacy.html` pipeline — `docs/` itself is not published), then update `LEGAL_CONFIG.documents`
- [ ] Decide and implement analytics for launch: load gtag or wire the existing Plausible provider into runtime init — production currently records no conversion events at all
- [ ] Replace corrupted `public/fonts/Inter-Variable.woff2` with a valid subsetted Inter variable font
- [ ] Fix download delivery: produce desktop artifacts (`Paperlyte-macOS.dmg`, `Paperlyte-Windows.exe`) in the release workflow or hide/replace those download buttons; verify App Store / Play Store listing URLs resolve (or hide them until launch)
- [ ] Wire `FeedbackWidget` to a submission backend or remove it from `App.tsx` until one exists
- [ ] Generate `og-image.jpg` / `twitter-image.jpg` from the existing SVGs (see `public/SOCIAL-IMAGE-GENERATION.md`) so social link previews work
- [ ] Decide Vercel support: add a subscribe function/proxy for Vercel or document the deployment as Netlify-only (note the WAF edge layer is also Netlify-only)
- [ ] Replace or remove unsubstantiated social proof: placeholder trust logos (`Hero.tsx`), fabricated statistics (`Statistics.tsx`), and unverified testimonials attributed to MIT/Stripe (`testimonials.ts`)
- [ ] Automate `CACHE_VERSION` bumps in `public/sw.js` (or add a release checklist step) so shell changes can't mix caches
- [ ] Update `docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md` — the March 31, 2026 conformance target has passed; publish audit results or revise the date
- [ ] Run Lighthouse against production [paperlyte.app](https://paperlyte.app) (field conditions) to confirm localhost scores hold

### Phase 2: Quick Wins

- [ ] Consolidate to a single Inter loading strategy (variable font preferred; removes ~222 KB of static font files from the build)
- [ ] Raise `useAnalytics.ts` coverage (64% → ≥80%) and cover `CTA.tsx` lines 41–47
- [ ] Refresh `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` and `TECHNICAL-DEBT.md` to reflect resolved findings; complete the pre-production security testing item
- [ ] Record manual screen-reader test results (VoiceOver/NVDA/JAWS) in the repo

### Phase 3: Ongoing

- [ ] Move from the launch analytics decision (Phase 1) to the privacy-first Plausible provider per the 2026-04-18 decision — the `src/analytics/` framework exists but is not initialized in runtime
- [ ] Monitor DOM size and bundle budgets as Phase 2 (conversion) sections land
- [ ] Refactor 300+ line components opportunistically when touched
- [ ] Quarterly re-audit cadence (next: ~September 2026 or at production launch, whichever first)

## Summary Statistics

**Bundle Performance:** ✅ EXCELLENT

- Total JS: 33% under budget (101.1 KB / 150 KB), split into 6 section chunks (all fetched on initial load — see splitting caveat)
- CSS: 56% under budget (13.2 KB / 30 KB)
- Vite bundling time: 0.63s (−84% vs December, same metric); full `npm run build` lifecycle: ~38s

**Lighthouse (local production build, 3 runs):** ✅ EXCELLENT — *new capability since December*

- Performance 100 / Accessibility 100 / Best Practices 100 / SEO 100
- FCP 441ms, LCP 632ms, CLS 0.000, TBT 0ms

**Technical Debt:** ✅ SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED

- Critical: 14 legal placeholders (4 also need content written and published) + broken/contradictory shipped static legal pages + unsubstantiated social proof (was 16 items incl. security)
- High: 7 — analytics disconnected, domain mismatch, corrupted font, Vercel waitlist gap, unwired FeedbackWidget (new); download URLs incl. desktop artifacts (carry-over)
- December's high-priority engineering items resolved except the store-listing portion of "Download URLs Incomplete"

**Test Coverage:** ✅ EXCELLENT (was "needs improvement")

- 1,757 tests, 0 failures; 95.1% lines / 93.7% statements / 86.5% branches
- 70% thresholds enforced; zero-coverage modules eliminated within the frontend scope (Netlify serverless/edge functions remain untested)

**Security:** 🟢 GOOD (improved)

- 0 dependency vulnerabilities; CRITICAL-001 and MEDIUM-001 resolved
- Five-layer defense in depth; docs need refresh

**Accessibility:** ✅ STRONG (statement overdue)

- Lighthouse 100/100; extensive ARIA + keyboard tests
- WCAG statement target date (2026-03-31) passed without update — needs action

**Production Readiness:** ⚠️ BLOCKED (narrower than December)

- Remaining blockers: legal content (constants placeholders, unwritten/unpublished policy docs, shipped static legal pages), unsubstantiated social proof (placeholder logos, fabricated stats, unverified testimonials), the sitemap domain mismatch, disconnected analytics, download delivery (desktop artifacts + store listings), the unwired FeedbackWidget, missing social-card images, and the Vercel waitlist gap (if Vercel remains a supported target)
- December's other blockers (.env, test coverage, Lighthouse verification) cleared
