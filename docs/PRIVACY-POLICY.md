### 3.1 Where We Store Your Data

**Primary Storage**: AWS data centers in us-east-1 (United States)

**International Transfers & Legal Mechanisms**:

- For users in the EU/EEA, UK, and other regions with data transfer laws, personal data is transferred to the United States under the protection of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission (GDPR Article 46), or UK-approved SCCs/IDTA for UK users. We also rely on AWS’s Data Processing Addendum (DPA), which incorporates EU and UK data transfer safeguards and certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR compliance).
- We do not rely on an EU adequacy decision for US transfers; SCCs and technical controls provide the required safeguards.
- Enterprise customers may request EU/UK regional data residency or storage options by contacting legal@paperlyte.com; these options are subject to availability and may require a custom DPA.
- All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256). Access by subprocessors is strictly limited and listed at [https://paperlyte.com/subprocessors](https://paperlyte.com/subprocessors).
