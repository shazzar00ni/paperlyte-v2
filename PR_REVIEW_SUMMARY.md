## PR #10: feat: add dependabot

**Status:** Reviewed

**Summary:**
This PR is incorrectly titled. It does not add Dependabot configuration. Instead, it adds a new file, `CLAUDE.md`, which provides a comprehensive guide for AI assistants working with the codebase.

**Feedback:**
- **Positive:** The `CLAUDE.md` file is well-documented and will be a valuable resource.
- **Suggestion:** The PR title should be updated to accurately reflect its contents, for example: `docs: add CLAUDE.md guide for AI assistants`.

**Action:**
No code changes are required. The PR can be merged after the title is corrected.
