This file contains a summary of pull requests I have reviewed.

## PR #260: refactor: add shared test helpers for analytics

- **Status:** Approved
- **Summary:** This PR adds a new file `src/test/analytics-helpers.ts` which contains a collection of well-documented test helpers for analytics testing. This is a good addition for improving the test suite.
- **Feedback:** No issues found. The code is clean and the helpers are useful. I will leave a comment on the PR and approve it.

## PR #262: fix: Fix intermittent Lighthouse CI failures

- **Status:** Approved with comments
- **Summary:** This PR addresses two separate issues. First, it corrects the port in `.lighthouserc.json` from 3000 to 4173, which should resolve the Lighthouse CI failures. Second, it introduces a well-documented workaround for a `querySelectorAll` bug in JSDOM, complete with a new test file to demonstrate the issue.
- **Feedback:** Both changes are valuable and well-implemented. However, they address unrelated concerns and should have been submitted in separate pull requests for better separation of concerns. I will approve the PR but leave a comment advising the author to split up unrelated changes in the future.

## PR #263: feat: add illustration component and enhance Solution section

- **Status:** Approved
- **Summary:** This PR introduces a new, well-implemented `Illustration` component and integrates it into the `Solution` section, enhancing the visual presentation. The component is well-tested and includes CSS modules for styling.
- **Feedback:** This is a solid feature addition with no issues found. The code is clean, and the new component is a great improvement.

## PR #265: ci: update vitest config for codecov

- **Status:** Approved with comments
- **Summary:** This PR is titled "ci: update vitest config for codecov," but it actually contains a number of valuable improvements to mobile responsiveness. The changes include fluid typography, new utility classes, and a new `viewport` utility to address the 100vh issue in iOS Safari.
- **Feedback:** The code changes are a significant improvement for mobile users and are well-implemented. However, the PR title is completely unrelated to the content. This is a recurring issue with this author's PRs, and I will leave a comment strongly advising them to use descriptive and accurate titles in the future.
