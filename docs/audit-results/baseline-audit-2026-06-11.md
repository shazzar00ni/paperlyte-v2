# Paperlyte Performance Baseline Audit (Updated)

**Date:** June 11, 2026
**Auditor:** Claude Code (Automated Baseline Audit)
**Repository:** [paperlyte-v2](https://github.com/shazzar00ni/paperlyte-v2)
**Production Site:** [paperlyte.com](https://paperlyte.com)
**Previous Audit:** [baseline-audit-2025-12-22.md](./baseline-audit-2025-12-22.md)
**Commits since previous audit:** ~1,496

## Audit Methodology

This updated audit re-runs the December 22, 2025 baseline methodology against the current codebase:

1. **Build Analysis**: Vite production build with bundle size metrics
2. **Code Quality Review**: Static analysis of TODO comments, test coverage, lint, and code patterns
3. **Security Review**: npm audit + analysis of SECURITY_REVIEW.md findings against current code
4. **Accessibility Review**: Analysis of ACCESSIBILITY.md and ARIA implementation
5. **Lighthouse Audit**: 3 runs via Lighthouse CI against the local production preview build — **now possible** (the December audit could not run Lighthouse due to missing Chrome)
6. **Technical Debt Inventory**: Comparison against the December baseline

**Environment:** Node 22.22.2, npm 10.9.7, Lighthouse 12.6.1, Headless Chromium 141, desktop preset (40ms RTT / 10 Mbps throttling, `.lighthouserc.json` config).

## Executive Summary

The codebase has improved dramatically since the December 2025 baseline. **Every high-priority engineering finding from the previous audit has been resolved**: test coverage went from large zero-coverage gaps to 95% lines across 1,757 passing tests; code splitting, image optimization (AVIF/WebP + srcset), coverage thresholds, and Lighthouse CI are all implemented; the critical `.gitignore`/`.env` security issue is fixed; and local Lighthouse runs now score **100/100/100/100** across all categories.

**Production launch remains blocked by one category of issue: 14 legal placeholders in `src/constants/legal.ts`.** Two new issues were also found: a corrupted font file shipped to production (`public/fonts/Inter-Variable.woff2` is an HTML document, not a font) and a redundant dual font-loading strategy.

## Build Performance Metrics

### Bundle Size Analysis (Actual vs. Targets)

**JavaScript Bundles (gzipped):**

Initial (critical path):

- `react-vendor-CPSICD2v.js`: 60.60 KB
- `index-axir51bO.js`: 27.74 KB
- `rolldown-runtime-xSXa1GVp.js`: 0.36 KB
- **Initial JS (gzipped): 88.70 KB** ✅ (Target: ≤150 KB)

Lazy-loaded chunks (below-the-fold sections, via `React.lazy()`):

- `EmailCapture`: 2.82 KB
- `FAQ`: 2.65 KB
- `Testimonials`: 2.56 KB
- `Statistics`: 2.24 KB
- `Comparison`: 1.39 KB
- `CTA`: 0.78 KB

- **Total JS (gzipped): 101.14 KB** ✅ (Target: ≤150 KB)
- **Status:** PASSING — 33% under budget; initial payload is 9% smaller than December (88.7 KB vs 97.1 KB) despite total growth, thanks to code splitting

**CSS Bundles (gzipped):**

- `index-sXtRVQL_.css`: 7.96 KB (critical path)
- Lazy section CSS (Testimonials, FAQ, Comparison, Statistics, CTA, EmailCapture): 5.19 KB combined
- **Total CSS (gzipped): 13.15 KB** ✅ (Target: ≤30 KB)
- **Status:** PASSING — 56% under budget (grew from 7.34 KB as sections were added, still well within budget)

**Build Time:**

- Total build time: **0.63 seconds** ✅ (was 3.85s in December — Vite 8 / Rolldown bundler upgrade)
- Post-build steps: legal-date injection into privacy.html/terms.html, sitemap generation

### Comparison vs. December 2025 Baseline

| Metric                  | Dec 2025      | Jun 2026                   | Change |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | ------ |
| Initial JS (gzipped)    | 97.13 KB      | 88.70 KB                   | ✅ −9% |
| Total JS (gzipped)      | 97.13 KB      | 101.14 KB                  | +4% (now split) |
| Total CSS (gzipped)     | 7.34 KB       | 13.15 KB                   | +79% (within budget) |
| Build time              | 3.85s         | 0.63s                      | ✅ −84% |
| Code splitting          | ❌ None       | ✅ 6 lazy section chunks   | Resolved |
| Lighthouse runnable     | ❌ No Chrome  | ✅ 3 runs, all 100s        | Resolved |

### Asset Inventory

**Font Assets:**

- `@fontsource/inter` static weights (loaded via `src/main.tsx`): 4× WOFF2 (~97 KB) + 4× WOFF fallback (~125 KB)
- Self-hosted variable fonts (declared in `src/styles/typography.css`, preloaded in `index.html`):
  - `PlayfairDisplay-Variable.woff2`: 38.4 KB ✅ (valid WOFF2)
  - `Inter-Variable.woff2`: 1.6 KB ❌ **corrupted — file is an HTML document, not a font** (see Findings)

**Image Assets (NEW since December):**

- ✅ App mockups in AVIF/WebP/PNG with responsive variants (400w / 800w / full) in `public/mockups/`
- ✅ `srcset`/`imagesrcset` responsive image preloading in `index.html`
- ✅ AVIF/WebP icon variants (android-chrome 192/512)
- ✅ SVG favicon, OG image, and Twitter card image

**PWA / Offline (NEW since December):**

- ✅ Service worker (`public/sw.js`) with versioned cache, offline fallback page, and asset-cache eviction (max 60 entries)
- ✅ `offline.html` + dedicated offline CSS/JS
- ✅ Web manifest

### December's "Missing Optimizations" — Status

| December finding                          | Status                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No WebP/AVIF format support               | ✅ RESOLVED — AVIF/WebP variants generated for mockups and icons    |
| No responsive images (srcset)             | ✅ RESOLVED — 400w/800w/full variants with srcset                   |
| No lazy loading for images                | ✅ RESOLVED — below-fold images lazy; hero image preloaded          |
| No React.lazy() / code splitting          | ✅ RESOLVED — 6 sections lazy-loaded with Suspense                  |
| Limited React.memo usage                  | ✅ ADDRESSED — `Section`, `AnimatedElement`, `Button` memoized; per project decision (2026-04-29), further memoization only when profiling shows need |
| `chunkSizeWarningLimit` raised to 1000 KB | ✅ RESOLVED — TODO removed from `vite.config.ts`; manual chunking in place |

## Lighthouse Results (NEW — was not runnable in December)

**Method:** `@lhci/cli` collect+assert, 3 runs against `vite preview` production build at `http://localhost:4173/`, desktop preset, headless Chromium 141.

**Category Scores (all 3 runs identical):**

- Performance: **100/100** ✅ (threshold: ≥90 target, ≥70 CI gate)
- Accessibility: **100/100** ✅ (threshold: ≥95 target, ≥82 CI gate)
- Best Practices: **100/100** ✅ (threshold: ≥90)
- SEO: **100/100** ✅ (threshold: ≥90)

**Core Web Vitals (median of 3 runs):**

- First Contentful Paint: **441ms** ✅ (target ≤2000ms)
- Largest Contentful Paint: **632ms** ✅ (target ≤2500ms)
- Cumulative Layout Shift: **0.000** ✅ (target ≤0.1)
- Total Blocking Time: **0ms** ✅ (target ≤300ms)
- Speed Index: **442ms** ✅ (target ≤3000ms)

**Assertion warnings (non-blocking):**

- `dom-size`: 881 elements (score 0.5) — moderate DOM size; acceptable for a content-rich landing page
- `unused-javascript`: ~21 KB of `react-vendor` (58.5 KB) unused on initial load — inherent to React runtime, low priority
- `network-dependency-tree-insight`: informational critical-request-chain notice

**Caveat:** These are localhost results — no real network latency, CDN, or third-party scripts (Sentry/analytics inactive without env vars). Real-world scores will be somewhat lower. Lighthouse CI now also runs on every PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` `lighthouse` job), closing December's "no automated performance monitoring" gap. Periodic field-data checks (CrUX / RUM) against [paperlyte.com](https://paperlyte.com) remain recommended.

## Code Quality

**Lint:** ✅ `npm run lint` passes with zero errors/warnings (ESLint 10, flat config).

**TODO comments in `src/`:** 1 (was 25+ in December) — a single explanatory note in `validation-email.test.ts` documenting an accepted email-regex limitation. All December TODO items in `src/analytics/index.ts`, `Privacy.tsx`, `Terms.tsx`, and `vite.config.ts` are resolved. (54 TODO mentions remain across `docs/*.md`, mostly mirroring the legal placeholders.)

**Tech stack (upgraded since December):** React 19.2.7, TypeScript 6.0.3 (strict), Vite 8.0.16 (Rolldown), Vitest 4.1.8, ESLint 10, Playwright 1.59.1, Sentry 10.56.

**Large components (largely unchanged — still candidates for eventual refactoring, low priority):**

1. `src/components/ui/FeedbackWidget/FeedbackWidget.tsx`: 355 lines (was 344)
2. `src/components/pages/Terms/Terms.tsx`: 346 lines (was 338)
3. `src/components/sections/Testimonials/Testimonials.tsx`: 281 lines
4. `src/components/pages/Privacy/Privacy.tsx`: 249 lines
5. `src/components/ui/EmailCapture/EmailCapture.tsx`: 244 lines
6. `src/components/ui/SVGPathAnimation/SVGPathAnimation.tsx`: 242 lines

All of these now have co-located test files, which mitigates the December maintainability concern.

## Test Coverage (was the largest gap — now resolved)

**Suite:** 1,757 tests, **0 failures**, ~31s runtime (Vitest, jsdom). Playwright E2E suite present (`tests/e2e/landing-page.spec.ts`).

**Coverage (v8 provider):**

- Statements: **93.72%** ✅ (threshold: 70%)
- Branches: **86.50%** ✅ (threshold: 70%)
- Functions: **91.28%** ✅ (threshold: 70%)
- Lines: **95.12%** ✅ (threshold: 70%)

**December gaps — all closed:**

| December finding                                   | Status                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Analytics module 0% (6 files untested)             | ✅ RESOLVED — config, index, scrollDepth, webVitals all tested |
| Constants module 0% (8 files untested)             | ✅ RESOLVED — all constants files have tests (incl. snapshots) |
| Utilities 50% (metaTags, monitoring, env untested) | ✅ RESOLVED — all utils tested; validation split into 4 test files |
| Privacy/Terms/EmailCapture untested                | ✅ RESOLVED — all have co-located test files                  |
| No coverage thresholds in vitest.config.ts         | ✅ RESOLVED — 70% thresholds enforced; JUnit + lcov reporters wired into CI |

**Remaining weak spots (minor):**

- `src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts`: 64% statements / 29% functions — lowest-covered module
- `src/components/sections/CTA/CTA.tsx`: 50% statements (lines 41–47 uncovered)

## Security Posture

### Overall Rating: 🟢 GOOD — improved since December

- ✅ **0 dependency vulnerabilities** (`npm audit` clean)
- ✅ **CRITICAL-001 RESOLVED**: `.env` patterns now in `.gitignore` (lines 24–29) — December's only critical security finding
- ✅ **MEDIUM-001 (SRI on Google Fonts) RESOLVED by elimination**: all fonts are now self-hosted (`@fontsource/inter` + local variable fonts); no Google Fonts CDN requests remain
- ✅ Defense-in-depth now spans five layers: WAF edge function (`netlify/edge-functions/waf.ts`), HTTP security headers (`netlify.toml`/`vercel.json`), two-tier CSP (dev meta tag / strict prod headers), app-boundary URL validation (`isSafeUrl()`) + prototype-pollution guards, and input validation/sanitization + rate limiting (3 req/min/IP) + Zod schema validation in serverless functions
- ✅ Font Awesome JS replaced with bundled SVG paths — removed the inline-style CSP violation
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode; no `any`; automated scanning in CI (Snyk, Scorecard, SonarCloud, CodeQL-style codescan, fuzzing workflow)

**Documentation staleness:** `docs/SECURITY_REVIEW.md` is dated 2025-11-29 and still marks MEDIUM-002 (CSP) and MEDIUM-003 (security headers) as UNRESOLVED, although both are implemented in `netlify.toml`/`vercel.json`. The document should be refreshed to reflect current state. Pre-production security testing (line ~340) also remains marked TODO.

## Accessibility Assessment

### Current Status: ⚠️ STRONG FOUNDATION, STATEMENT OVERDUE

- ✅ **Lighthouse Accessibility: 100/100** (all 3 runs) — exceeds the ≥95 target
- ✅ 266 ARIA attributes across components; semantic HTML; skip link; 2px focus outlines
- ✅ `prefers-reduced-motion` honored via `useReducedMotion` (tested)
- ✅ Keyboard utilities with dedicated tests (`src/utils/keyboard.test.ts`); FeedbackWidget, Header, FAQ have keyboard interaction tests
- ✅ Accessibility statement exists (`docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md`)

**Issues:**

1. ⚠️ **WCAG 2.1 AA conformance target date has passed** — `docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md` commits to full conformance by **March 31, 2026** and was last updated December 21, 2025. As of this audit (June 11, 2026) the statement has not been updated with audit results. Either publish the completed-audit results or revise the statement and target date.
2. ⚠️ The accessibility statement link in site config (`LEGAL_CONFIG.documents.accessibility`) is still `'#'` even though the statement document exists — users cannot reach it from the footer.
3. ⚠️ Manual assistive-technology testing (VoiceOver/NVDA/JAWS, touch-target verification) is described in docs but no test results are recorded in the repo. Automated scores ≠ full WCAG conformance.

## Technical Debt Inventory

### 🔴 Critical Issues — BLOCKS PRODUCTION (14 placeholders, down from 16 items)

**Legal Placeholders (`src/constants/legal.ts`)** — detectable at runtime via the existing `needsLegalReview()` helper:

1. `company.legalName`: `'[Company Legal Name]'`
2. `address.street`: `'[Street Address]'`
3. `address.city`: `'[City]'`
4. `address.state`: `'[State]'`
5. `address.zip`: `'[ZIP]'`
6. `address.country`: `'[Country]'`
7. `documents.cookies`: `'#'` — note: `docs/COOKIE-POLICY.md` **exists**; only the link wiring is missing
8. `documents.security`: `'#'` — `docs/SECURITY-POLICY.md` exists; link wiring missing
9. `documents.dmca`: `'#'` — `docs/DMCA.md` exists; link wiring missing
10. `documents.accessibility`: `'#'` — `docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md` exists; link wiring missing
11. `social.linkedin`: `'#'`
12. `social.discord`: `'#'`
13. `metadata.jurisdiction`: `'[State/Country]'`
14. `metadata.governingLaw`: `'[State] law'`

**Resolved since December:** `social.github` (now the real repo URL — this also fixed the Windows/macOS/Linux download URL construction), `social.twitter` (now `x.com/paperlyte`), Instagram added, and Privacy/Terms revision dates are now injected at build time (no stale-date TODOs).

### 🟠 High Priority (down from 4 items to 2)

1. **Corrupted production font file (NEW):** `public/fonts/Inter-Variable.woff2` is an HTML document (1.6 KB, begins `<!DOCTYPE`), not a WOFF2 font. It is preloaded in `index.html` and referenced by the primary `Inter` `@font-face` in `src/styles/typography.css`. The font silently fails to parse and the site falls back to the `@fontsource/inter` static files (so rendering is unaffected), but every visitor preloads a broken asset and the variable-font strategy is non-functional. Replace with a valid Inter variable WOFF2 — `PlayfairDisplay-Variable.woff2` (38.4 KB, valid) shows the intended pattern.
2. **Store URLs unverified:** `downloads.ts` iOS (`apps.apple.com/app/paperlyte`) and Android (`play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paperlyte.app`) URLs are now populated but point to listings that won't resolve until the apps are published. Verify before launch.

**Resolved since December:** Analytics test coverage ✅, Lighthouse CI ✅ (runs in GitHub Actions on every PR), keyboard-handler concerns addressed with tested keyboard utilities ✅.

### 🟡 Medium Priority

1. **Dual font-loading strategy (NEW):** both `@fontsource/inter` static weights (4 weights × WOFF2+WOFF ≈ 222 KB of font files in `dist/assets/`) and a self-hosted Inter variable font are declared for the same `font-family: 'Inter'`. Once the corrupted variable font is fixed, drop one strategy — consolidating on the variable font would remove ~8 static font files from the build.
2. **Stale audit/security docs:** `docs/SECURITY_REVIEW.md` (2025-11-29) and `docs/TECHNICAL-DEBT.md` (2025-12-29) predate major fixes and overstate current debt (e.g., both still list the resolved `.gitignore` and zero-coverage issues). Refresh or mark superseded.
3. **`useAnalytics` hook coverage (64%)** and the GA4→Plausible provider migration (decision logged 2026-04-18) remain open.
4. **DOM size:** 881 elements (Lighthouse score 0.5, warning only). Worth watching as Phase 2 sections are added.

### 🟢 Low Priority

1. Large-component refactoring (FeedbackWidget 355 / Terms 346 / Testimonials 281 lines) — mitigated by full test coverage
2. ~21 KB unused `react-vendor` JS on initial load (inherent React runtime cost)
3. CTA section test coverage (50% statements)

## Findings by Severity — Summary

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Production Blockers)

1. **14 Legal Placeholders** — `src/constants/legal.ts`
   - Impact: Cannot launch without legal entity, address, jurisdiction, governing law
   - Note: 4 of the 14 are pure link-wiring (policy documents already written)
   - Owner: Legal & Compliance; ETA: required before launch

### 🟠 HIGH

1. **Corrupted `Inter-Variable.woff2`** (HTML masquerading as a font) — replace the file; visitors currently preload a broken asset
2. **App Store / Play Store URLs unverified** — confirm listings before launch

### 🟡 MEDIUM

1. Dual font-loading strategy — consolidate after fixing the variable font
2. Stale security/tech-debt documentation — refresh `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`, `TECHNICAL-DEBT.md`, `ACCESSIBILITY.md` (target date passed)
3. GA4 → privacy-first analytics migration still pending (brand-promise gap)

### 🟢 LOW

1. Component refactoring, CTA/useAnalytics coverage, unused vendor JS, DOM size monitoring

## Recommendations Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pre-Production Critical Path

- [ ] Resolve all 14 legal placeholders in `src/constants/legal.ts` (entity, address, jurisdiction, governing law, LinkedIn/Discord or remove the links)
- [ ] Wire the four existing policy docs (cookies, security, DMCA, accessibility) to public URLs and update `LEGAL_CONFIG.documents`
- [ ] Replace corrupted `public/fonts/Inter-Variable.woff2` with a valid subsetted Inter variable font
- [ ] Verify App Store / Play Store listing URLs resolve (or hide those buttons until launch)
- [ ] Update `docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md` — the March 31, 2026 conformance target has passed; publish audit results or revise the date
- [ ] Run Lighthouse against production [paperlyte.com](https://paperlyte.com) (field conditions) to confirm localhost scores hold

### Phase 2: Quick Wins

- [ ] Consolidate to a single Inter loading strategy (variable font preferred; removes ~222 KB of static font files from the build)
- [ ] Raise `useAnalytics.ts` coverage (64% → ≥80%) and cover `CTA.tsx` lines 41–47
- [ ] Refresh `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` and `TECHNICAL-DEBT.md` to reflect resolved findings; complete the pre-production security testing item
- [ ] Record manual screen-reader test results (VoiceOver/NVDA/JAWS) in the repo

### Phase 3: Ongoing

- [ ] Execute GA4 → Plausible (privacy-first) analytics migration per 2026-04-18 decision
- [ ] Monitor DOM size and bundle budgets as Phase 2 (conversion) sections land
- [ ] Refactor 300+ line components opportunistically when touched
- [ ] Quarterly re-audit cadence (next: ~September 2026 or at production launch, whichever first)
