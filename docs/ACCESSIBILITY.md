# Accessibility Statement

**Visibility:** This statement is public and applies to all users of the Paperlyte platform and website.

## Commitment to Accessibility

Paperlyte is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for all users, including people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience and applying relevant accessibility standards.

## Conformance Status

Our goal is to conform to [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) standards. As of December 2, 2025, a full accessibility audit is scheduled and in progress. Some areas of the site may not yet fully conform. We will update this statement after the audit is complete.

## Supported Assistive Technologies & Testing

We aim to support users with:

- Screen readers (tested with VoiceOver, NVDA, and JAWS)
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Browser zoom and text resizing
- High-contrast and dark mode settings

Testing is performed using automated tools (axe, Lighthouse, WAVE) and manual checks on major browsers and operating systems.

## Known Limitations

While we strive for full accessibility, some known limitations may exist:

- Some third-party widgets or embedded content may not be fully accessible
- Occasional missing or incorrect ARIA labels
- Incomplete alt text for decorative images
- PDF or downloadable documents may not be fully tagged for accessibility

We are actively working to address these issues. If you encounter a problem not listed here, please let us know.
